# Secure Flask Login Application

This Flask application is designed to provide a robust and secure login system. Below are the steps we've taken to ensure security:

1. **Database-Driven Authentication**  
   User credentials are stored securely in an SQLite database, ensuring fast and reliable access.

2. **Custom Query Building**  
   We've implemented dynamic query construction to allow flexibility in user input handling. This ensures our code can handle diverse authentication needs.

3. **Detailed Logging for Testing**  
   The app includes detailed logging to help developers test and verify input handling, making debugging seamless.
